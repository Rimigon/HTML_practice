      <h2>Here's a time line of Auguste Comte life:</h2>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><span class="bold">1798</span> - born in Montpellier, Hérault on 19 January, at the time under the rule of the newly founded French First Republic</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1817</span> - found an apartment at 36 Rue Bonaparte in Paris's 6th arrondissement (where he lived until 1822) and later that year he became a student and secretary to Henri de Saint-Simon, who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1822</span> - published a Plan de travaux scientifiques nécessaires pour réorganiser la société (Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1824</span> - left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1825</span> - married Caroline Massin</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1826</span> - he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured – only stabilized by French alienist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol – so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the Pont des Arts)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1842</span> - divorce with Caroline Massin</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1844</span> - he fell deeply in love with the Catholic Clotilde de Vaux, although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new "Religion of Humanity"</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1851–1854</span> - published four volumes of Système de politique positive</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1856</span> - the first volume of La Synthèse Subjective ("The Subjective Synthesis")</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1857</span>  - died in Paris on 5 September</li>
      </ul>
